## Problems and How I Fixxed Them
- I had to find a way to make all the walls appear
- - I ended up finding that using the platformer code example would be my best option.

- I had to find a way to make collision
- - I had to look around online at other peoples code and found one that worked with mine(i had a link for it but it got deleted)

- Moving
- - moving was easy just a x and y and checking if KeyIsDown

#
## Favorite Part
